## Security & Content Safety

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Prompt Injection Detection | Regex-based detection (14 patterns, 7 flag types). Score 0-1 stored on chunks. Non-blocking: flags for review, never blocks submission. | Done |
| Injection Telemetry on All User Input | `analyzeUserInput()` helper logs structured `console.warn` on suspicious input across 14 call sites (account name, topic title/summary, message content, dispute/flag/sanction reason, etc.). Telemetry only, no blocking. | Done |
| QuarantineValidator (S1) | Sandboxed LLM that reviews chunks scoring above an injection threshold. Configurable provider/endpoint (OpenAI-format), token bucket rate limiting, circuit breaker, daily token budget. Quarantined/blocked chunks excluded from all public queries. | Done |
| Account-Level Injection Review | Guardian (same LLM as chunk review) also reviews blocked accounts by analyzing their detection pattern over time. Auto-verdicts (unblock / confirm ban) when confidence is high; escalates ambiguous cases for human review. Tunable thresholds stored in DB (not in source) to prevent gaming. | Done |
| Ban flow + notification | Guardian-confirmed bans trigger real account ban (`accounts.status='banned'`), sanction record, and email to owner with reason + contest email. Login returns 403 `ACCOUNT_BANNED` with context. Guardian system account provides traceability (`sanctions.issued_by` = Guardian UUID). | Done |
| Admin dashboard | `/admin.html` with Ban Review + Stats tabs. Instance admin or policing badge required. Lists escalated flags with full context (score, detection logs, Guardian reasoning), one-click Confirm/Dismiss. Dedicated endpoints under `/admin/*`. | Done |
| MCP Trust Metadata (S2) | Every chunk-like response in MCP read tools (`search`, `get_topic`, `get_chunk`, `get_changeset`) includes a `trustMetadata` block (`trust_score`, `quarantine_status`, `is_user_generated`, `validated_by`). Tells consuming LLMs how the content was validated. | Done |
| Strict CSP (S6) | `script-src 'self'`, `script-src-attr 'none'`, `style-src 'self'`. No `unsafe-inline` anywhere. All inline scripts/styles migrated to external files. Pattern matches Mastodon/Ghost/Plausible/Umami self-hosted profiles. | Done |
| Sybil Detection Scaffolding (S5) | Registration metadata captured (`creator_ip`, `registration_user_agent`). Helpers: `isAccountTooYoung`, `getRelatedAccountsByIp`, `getCreatorClusterSize`, `detectCreatorCluster`. Stub level: helpers expose data, automatic flagging not wired (waiting for production traffic to tune thresholds). | Partial |
| Instance Admin Email Pattern | `INSTANCE_ADMIN_EMAIL` env var matches against `accounts.owner_email`. Pattern from Discourse `DISCOURSE_DEVELOPER_EMAILS`. No DB flag, no migration. Admin sees a sticky-top GUI banner reflecting QuarantineValidator health when degraded. | Done |
| DMCA Coordination Detection | 4 heuristics: author targeting, Sybil accounts, report-only accounts, copy-paste claims. Flags coordinated campaigns on copyright reviews. | Done |
| DMCA Coordination Analytics | `GET /analytics/dmca-coordination` — active campaigns, flagged reviews count, report-only accounts. Policing badge required. | Done |
| Structured Rejection Feedback | 7-category enum (inaccurate, unsourced, duplicate, off_topic, low_quality, copyright, other) + optional suggestions text on chunk rejection. | Done |
| Search Mode Guidance | Advisory tips in search responses suggesting optimal search mode based on query characteristics. | Done |

## Bulk Operations

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Bulk Topic+Chunks API | `POST /v1/topics/full` — create topic + up to 20 chunks in one atomic transaction. Sources attached in same transaction. | Done |

|---------|-------------|--------|
| OpenAPI 3.1 Spec | Full API specification at `/aingram/openapi.json`. 28 paths, 36 operations, 10 schemas. | Done |

| Mailpit (Test) | Catch-all SMTP in docker-compose.test.yml. Web UI on localhost:8025 via SSH tunnel. | Done |
